Making an Art with MandelBrotset

Hi there!
What you see here is my work trying to make an art(if you can call it an art) using the amazing world of mandelbrot set that you can learn about it in here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set.

I used the C language because it was fast for making the pictures and using the ffmpeg putting together the pages to make a video,
also I used SonicPi for making music with code and using the ffmpeg converting this pictures and music to the final video which is "out.mp4".

Hope you enjoy it and if you have any comments or issues write to my Gmail.Thank you!
